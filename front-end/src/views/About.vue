            Spanish. You can add new words, view existing words, edit words, and test your knowledge by taking
            vocabulary quizzes.</p>
        <h2>1. Search for Word</h2>
        <p>On the words list page, you can search for a specific word by using the search bar at the top. Simply enter
            the word (or part of it) in the search field, and the table will filter the words to match the search
            criteria.</p>
        <h2>2. Create New Word</h2>
